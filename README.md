# discrete-event-simulation-in-a-queueing-theory-model-with-N-vacancy
#this is our final study project there is still some things to change 
discrete event simulation in queueing theory with N threshold policy using C#
in this project we developed a tool to simulate the performances of a wireless sensor node and basiclly the energy consummption
we modeled the buffer as a queue with two types ( finite capacity and infinite capacity)
we use the N threshold policy to serve the packets
the packets arrives randomly with poisson process with mean arrival lambda
we have three type of priority of packets ( low - medium - high ) and each packet arrives with it's own mean arrival lambda
